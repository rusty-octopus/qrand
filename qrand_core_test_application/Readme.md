# Todo

1. Write an application with no_main etc. to test out if it is actually working for embedded
    * Use this: [Getting Started with the nRF52840 in Rust](https://nitschinger.at/Getting-Started-with-the-nRF52840-in-Rust/)
2. Can this be an example qrand_core later on?
    * What about dependencies like defmt?
